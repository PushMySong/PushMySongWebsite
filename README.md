<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


PushMySong is a small community which is built by us. 
With PushMySong we offer small musical artists a chance to build a community and at the same time get honest feedback from our listeners.
This way our listeners get to know new artists and give something back to the artists at the same time.
We are currently building our website, which establishes a feedback + streaming system of music.
Features of PushMySong:
* Direct feedback for the artists
* New music for the listeners
* Big community
